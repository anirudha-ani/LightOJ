Algorithm Used - KMP 

Solving Technique - I inverted the string and build a new String like this

newString = <inverted string> <"#"> <main string>

If we run KMP on this in the last index it will save the number
which indicates what is the highest length of prefix of the inverted string
that match with the suffix with the original string
basically that length we don't want to be added
